lately i've had a build up of tonnes of unorganised scripts from my random projects over the past three years so
I'm the one and only @PeanutSaturn


need others to tell me I've done wrong, if you can, anyways I don't have any plans for collaborations yet but have done a couple small thing with others within my projects maybe around six. but oh well lets still 
 





mainly make lil ol solo games w unity plus a little with unreal too and  | get started finally | | ! |






you know ive gotta sort that out some way to organise these things (also i've tried to make some of my bigger scripts labeled for others to understand them but lots of them are un-neat.
I am not fully aware of how your meant to use GitHub but itll probably be five
